# Overview

This software as a ROS package file is meant to send commands to the ROS server from the command files (launch and yaml). These launch files 
push from the terminal. The terminal uploads the perameters from the yaml first and uses the package that I chose called laser_filters. Once
the paramaters are placed I can load up the test.load file showing a visual representation of what my LIDAR scanner is showing me.

My purpose for creating this is to progress the big project of my robot. It's a big part of the AI and finding its way around the rooms of a house
or general area of some sort.

# Development Environment

The tools I used are git, Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, ROS SDK - Noetic, Ubuntu 20.04, catkin_make pkg, laser_filter pkg

The programming language I used for this was xml for the launch file and uses the Perl language for the yaml file configurations.
